<p>
    Choosing a wood stain is a matter of personal preference and do-it-yourselfers have a variety of stains to choose
    from. Stains such as Minwax® Wood Finish™ feature traditional wood tones, while Water-Based Stains (which includes
    50 custom colors) allow you to select a stain color that coordinates with your decor. Tip: Before staining, always
    test the selected stain on a hidden area of your piece, or on scrap wood that matches the wood species of your
    project.
